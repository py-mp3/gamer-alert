             <p>Gamescom may be going digital this year, but Geoff Keighley will still be hosting his annual Opening Night Live games showcase on August 27, with The Game Awards host promising we'll see more PS5 gameplay during the event.</p>
             <p>Keighley has tweeted that we will be seeing the world premiere demo of Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart in action during Opening Night Live. This means we could get our best look yet at a PS5 game in action ahead of the console's release in just a few months.</p>

             <p>Last week, Epic filed for a temporary restraining order to prevent Apple from terminating all of Epic’s developer accounts and cutting the company off from iOS and Mac development tools, which would go into affect on Friday August 28, 2020. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California heard arguments from both sides yesterday, and eventually ruled that while Fortnite would not be returned to the App Store, Unreal Engine was safe.</p>

             <p>Halo Infinite was set to be a launch title for the Xbox Series X, but it has since been delayed until 2021. And it could be in more trouble.
             According to a Microsoft insider going by the name of ‘sponger’ on the Resetera forums, Halo Infinite is undergoing a lot of work to get it in shape for the Xbox Series X. So much so that Xbox One support for the game might be dropped.</p>
